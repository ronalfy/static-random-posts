== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would someone want "static" random posts? =

In my opinion, it's a usability enhancement to a website.  I've found myself browsing sites that have random posts listed.  Sometimes I want to view more than one of those posts in the sidebar, but when I click on one, the whole thing refreshes.

Having the random posts remain static for a period of time gives the user the opportunity to browse all of the random posts present.

Furthermore, having the random posts static for a time may aid in SEO.

= What's the "Refresh" feature for? = 

Say, for example, you have the refresh rate set for sixty minutes.  You look at the current random posts, but aren't impressed with what's showing.  You can click "Refresh" until a suitable line-up of posts are displayed.

= Can I provide a translation? =
